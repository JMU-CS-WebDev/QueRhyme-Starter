      // Guidelines:
      // 1. Query for rhymes using Rhymebrain’s API (Links to an external site.). Ignore the form at the top of the page. Skip down to the section labeled RhymeBrain.com Advanced Access. The Rhyming box shows you how to access the endpoint and interpret the JSON it sends back.
      // 2. Present the words in the order they are returned from Rhymebrain.
      // 3. Size each word accordings to its score. Set the size directly using a style assignment and an arithmetic expression. Do not use classes.
      // 4. Ensure the words all sit on the same baseline.
      // 5. Notice there’s no button to trigger the search. On each input event, schedule the rhymes to be pulled down after 1 second has elapsed. If another input happens before the retrieval task fires, cancel the previously scheduled task and schedule a new one for the new word. setTimeout is useful for scheduling tasks to run in the future.
      // 6. If the user types Enter (or Return) in the input, which you can detect in a keydown event, cancel any scheduled task and fire off an immediate retrieval of the rhymes.
      // 7. Create and attach new elements to the DOM directly. Avoid using innerHTML. This forces the browser to do an unnecessary parsing step.

      // Consider (talk with your partner(s) about, and ask questions here):
      // 1. what event listeners will you need?
      // 2. what will be the general steps to implement the functionality?
